# Class: Android Development Projects

## Description

Explore android development

### Notes

The proejcts were uploaded to my personal github from school and most of the files were removed since they weren't necessary to showcase my code.

The goal of the project will be stated below.

Some projects weren't included as they weren't interesting enough.

Some project READMEs were updated to better explain the project.

Projects will have a src file with my code, and a res file for any resources or layouts I used.

Projects were coded using Java

## Map Picture

An app that will allow you to take a picture, and place it on google maps at the users current GPS coordinates as a landmark. The user will be able to tap the landmark and the picture will be displayed. (Pictures didn't need to survive app closure)
